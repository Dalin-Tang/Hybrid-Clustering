# Hybrid-Clustering
Traffic state classification based on DBSCAN-natural break hybrid clustering
"bj_test.csv": is test data. The first column is the road name, and the second column is the speed of the road segment.
The code testing sample is as shown in File "test".
The implementation of hybrid clustering and the correlation analysis of relative speed thresholds between adjacent traffic states is provided in the file "indx_vvf_relapartion_DBSACN_NaturalBreaks"
The test case utilizes "test" , with "test_bj" as the corresponding test data. 
The expected output can be found in "output.txt"
